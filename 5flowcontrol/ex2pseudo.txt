Write a method that takes a string as an argument. 
The method should return a new, all-caps version of the string, 
only if the string is longer than 10 characters. Example: change 
"hello world" to "HELLO WORLD". (Hint: Ruby's String class has a 
few methods that would be helpful. Check the Ruby Docs!)

1. define method
2. check if the string is at least 10 characters
3. if it is, change it to uppercase
4. if not, print a message saying it isn't all caps
5. end method

6. get string from user
7. use that string as an argument
