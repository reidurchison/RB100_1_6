Exercise 7

It's not A, because array variables don't have keys

I think B seems like the clear answer

It's not C, because I don't think C makes sense... 
    - I don't think arrays get "defined", and even if they do that would mean that keys isn't already an array object
    - we're talking about the METHOD being undefined, not the array
    
It's not D, because the error is about a method, not a string 

Correct! :)
