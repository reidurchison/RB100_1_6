Summary of this section

1. Regex
    =~ or .match
    /regex/
    
2. Ruby standard classes
    use them
    
3. Variables as pointers
    variables don't contain the value => they point to where the value is located in memory (an address space)
      i.e. variables are pointers to a physical space in memory; they are labels we create to refer to some physical memory address in your computer
    Some operations mutate the address space (e.g. <<) while others simply make the variable point to a different address space (e.g. =)
    
4. Blocks and Procs
    BLOCKS
      you can pass a block into a method (using do/end)
      use an ampersand in the parameters for the method definition to indicate it is a block (e.g. def take_block(&block)
      the block must always be the last parameter
    PROCS
      procs are blocks that are wrapped in a proc object and stored in a variable to be passed around
      
5. Exception Handling
    rescue
    Exception is a class that handles (certain types of?) errors
      uses reserved words: begin, rescue, end (in that order)
    rescue can provide a fallback in case of an error, so that the program can continue to run and not just stop at the point of the error

6. Exceptions & Stack Traces
    an "exception" is like an error (can consider them synonymous for now)
    
7. Method Definition Order
    Rule of thumb: define all methods before invoking any of them - define all methods, then put the main program code at the bottom of the program.
